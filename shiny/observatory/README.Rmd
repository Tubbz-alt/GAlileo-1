# Observatory

## Getting started
Run the app from app.R
Put submodules in their own R files then include into app.R, adding the component to UI and the server function to Server.

## Adding new R packages
First check if there is an "r-cran" APT package for the package by searching on https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=r-cran&searchon=names&suite=bionic&section=all which you can add to apt.yml:
```
packages:
  - r-cran-shiny
```

Otherwise add new R packages to r.yml:
```
    packages:
      - name: shiny
```
